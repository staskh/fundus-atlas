# VascX fovea detection

Locates the fovea — the centre of vision, a small pit near the middle of the retina with no vessels over it. VascX needs it as a landmark rather than as an anatomical measurement: the axis between the optic disc and the fovea orients every region-based biomarker, and defines what counts as superior, inferior, nasal and temporal.

It is one of five models released together as the VascX ensembles; each is catalogued separately.
The others are [vessels](vascx-vessels.md), [artery/vein](vascx-artery-vein.md),
[disc](vascx-disc.md), [fovea](vascx-fovea.md) and [quality](vascx-quality.md) — minus this one.

## 1. Code reference

- **Repository:** https://github.com/Eyened/retinalysis-vascx (inference and biomarkers); model
  execution lives in the companion package `retinalysis-inference`.
- **Version described here:** commit `d0cde1c7` (2026-08-07), tag `v0.2.0`; PyPI
  `retinalysis-vascx` 1.4.0.
- **Most recent commit:** 2026-08
- **Training code included:** No. No training script was found in the repository; the training
  procedure is described in the paper only, so this model can be run but not retrained.
- **Language and how it runs:** Python with PyTorch, as part of `vascx run-models`. This model can
  be replaced with `--fovea-model`, or by placing a file at `fovea/fovea_july24.pt` inside a directory given by
  `--model-dir` or the `VASCX_MODEL_DIR` environment variable.

## 2. License

- **Code:** Not stated — the repository has no LICENSE file and the PyPI metadata leaves the field
  empty.
- **Model weights:** AGPL-3.0, as stated on the
  [Hugging Face model page](https://huggingface.co/Eyened/vascx). Strong copyleft, with
  consequences for network services.

## 4. What it produces

- **Purpose:** `other`
- **Output classes:** the fovea's location, as a point rather than a region.
- **Input expected:** a colour-fundus photograph, in standard image formats or DICOM. Preprocessing
  is not optional: the pipeline crops to the field of view and enhances contrast first.
- **Preprocessing in the published code:** performed by
  [retinalysis-fundusprep](https://github.com/Eyened/retinalysis-fundusprep) (AGPL-3.0), which the
  authors report succeeds in detecting image bounds on 99.5% of a diverse set — their measurement.

## 5. Architecture

- **Family:** U-Net, per the paper, trained with a new preprocessing algorithm and strong data
  augmentation.
- **Parameters:** Unknown.
- **Single model or ensemble:** an ensemble; the member count is in the paper.

## 6. Training data

| Dataset | Role | Annotations by | Split stated |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| More than fifteen published annotated datasets, combined | Training | Their own authors | In the paper; the per-model split is not restated here |
| Dutch cohort images, principally the Rotterdam Study | Training | The cohort's graders | In the paper |

The training set absorbs most of the public annotated data, so few public datasets remain for a
blind benchmark of this model. That cuts both ways: broad training is why it generalises, and also
why an independent evaluation is hard to construct.

## 7. Weights

- **Publicly available:** Yes.
- **Download URL:** https://huggingface.co/Eyened/vascx — file `fovea/fovea_july24.pt`.
- **Format and size:** PyTorch `.pt`, fetched automatically by the inference code.
- **Files in an ensemble:** one file, itself an ensemble checkpoint.

## 8. Performance as reported by the authors

Reported in the VascX Models paper. Numbers are in that paper and are not restated here.

## 9. Used by

| Project | How it is used | Weights |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [VascX](../projects/vascx.md) | One stage of `vascx run-models` | The published weights |

## 10. Known defects

None recorded as of 2026-09-10 — an absence of findings, not a clean bill of health.

## 11. Notes

- A landmark model, not a segmentation: it returns a coordinate.
- If the fovea is not visible in the photograph, region-based biomarkers that need it are not
  computed rather than estimated — a deliberate choice by the authors, and the reason VascX output
  tables contain empty cells rather than unreliable numbers.
